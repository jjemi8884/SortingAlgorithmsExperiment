# Sorting Algorithms Experiment

Purpose: To practice and demonstrate proficiency in creating algorithms for sorting as well as testing and analyzing their efficiencies.

Skills Used: Java programming

Knowledge Goals: Sorting Algorithm Efficiencies




## Summary

In this project, you will use Java to run experiments in testing the efficiencies of the Sorting Algorithms: 

- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Shell Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort (pivot selected as first element)
- Quick Sort (pivot selected as random element)
- Quick Sort (pivot selected with Median-of-three)
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort

In addition to the coding, a Word document final report will be created that will detail the design and experimental results.




## Part 1: Designing the Experiment

When you are designing your experiment, you and your team will determine the following:

Design a UML document for your software's organization.
Decide on reasonable inputs and how to generate reasonable sample inputs. 
Array sizes: array of any sizes between powers of two, starting with 4: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..., 32768] for a total of 14 arrays.
Integers included: integers between 0 and 40,000. There can be duplicate values and its encouraged. 
Test the following variations of input configurations to test:
- Random Ordered Array
- Reverse Ordered Array
- Ordered Array
- 50% Ordered Array
- 75% Ordered Array
With the above, that means there will 14 * 5 = 70 arrays that you will test per sorting algorithm. Do not attempt to manually create these yourself. Use programming techniques and random number generation to create them. Once you can do it for one sorting algorithm, you will have the basis to do it quickly for all of them.
Metrics for complexity measurement.
Size of data input
Select one of the following. Decide which of these two following metrics to use consistently across your project. Pick one or the other.
Count actual number of basic operation's executions
Record the number of microseconds (nanoseconds / 1000) the algorithms takes.
Decide on how the results will be displayed
Plan on displaying results using a plot chart. You can do this by either using Java libraries or outputting a file and generating them in Excel. Other forms of data visualization may be approved with permission.
Add Experiment Design details into Final Report Document. Include the UML document, specifications on metrics chosen as well as the chosen results display. Discuss reasoning for organization of code.




## Part 2: Java Implementation

Implement the algorithms previously mentioned in Java and perform the experiments with the chosen input lists. Results should be evaluated in terms of the metrics.

The implementation of this is largely up to you. Here are a few things I look for in well-designed implementations:

Follows principles of OOP: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
I'm not checking for each one of these. Obviously, there are situations where none or very few will be used and there are situations where all may be used. Use your discretion.
Well-organized project structure.
This could include multiple packages or possibly not. 
Use of Interfaces.
For any classes where it will be relevant, use of interfaces is a great idea. 
Easy-to-understand output for testing.
Output for this project will contain two parts: 
- Part 1: Evidence of successful execution by printing output from main into Terminal.
- Part 2: Output printed to files that will be used to create charts OR separate Chart visualizations by using Java libraries.
- You are required to implement 3 Junit tests that tests 3 methods.
Because you will be using graphs in this project, some of your output will be in charts. You will either need to do your research around how to create charts in Java or output to text files and create charts separately.
Output your data structures with your data to output text files.




## Part 3: Illustrating and Analyzing Results

In this step, you will provide charts to illustrate the performance of the algorithms. Action items:

- Compare the performance of all of the algorithms using plot charts. Each type of array (Ordered, Reverse Ordered, etc.) will have a plot. That means there will be 5 plots per sorting algorithm. There are 12 sorting algorithms so there will be a total of 60 plots in your final result.
- Compare the performance of all the algorithms in words. Which were fastest for smaller data sets and which for larger? Discuss what sort of tradeoffs each algorithm makes and what algorithms are suited for what type of applications, such as large systems, distributed systems, embedded systems, mobile systems, etc.
- Final Report: Include sections on the design, experimental results (charts) and provide comments in your program that discuss the empirical results with the theoretical results. Why did you pick the second metric you chose as a team (Number of Operations or Time of Execution)? Do your findings meet theoretical expectations? Why did you choose the implementations that you did for the sorting algorithms? Why did you reject other implementations that you researched? All of these questions must be addressed per sorting algorithm.





## Some other items of importance
Use javadoc comments on your functions to explain what they do. You do not have to do this in the class implementations where there is an interface, you can use @inheritDoc.
Be sure your code is clean, legible and easy to read.
Feel free to go above and beyond!  Add new methods and functionality, test in different ways in addition to what you are required to do, be creative! The top grades go to those who go above and beyond. Strive for excellence.
You are not required to create unit tests but are welcome to do so if you wish.
Including the runtime as a comment on algorithms with loops in them will be seen as going above and beyond as well.




## Format Requirements
Please ensure you follow the structure as listed above. Use IntelliJ to do your work. Use javadoc comments where appropriate.
Your submissions will be by providing a link to your Team's Github repo where this code is stored.
For your final report, be as professional as possible. I am not putting direct limitations on its length. You can choose what format you want it to be in: Word, Markdown language or whatever you feel is most appropriate. I'll even accept a final report via slides in Powerpoint. Ensure your team wants to submit it as such and ensure that it answers all the questions from above for each algorithm and showcases each plot accordingly.
